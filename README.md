# Election_System_Code:
This Java project implements a basic election system using a graphical user interface (GUI). 
It allows multiple users (e.g., 10 voters or more) to vote for candidates,
and after voting, it displays a colorful chart graph showing the votes each candidate received.
also there's a main class to see the work in terminal.
Finally, it congratulates the winner on a separate colorful panel.

## Requirements
- Java JDK
- Maven
- JFreeChart (for chart display)
